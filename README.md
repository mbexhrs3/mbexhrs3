## Summary:
My name is Rudra Shrestha. I am a Data Scientist. I have more than 10 years of working experience in climate science, climate modelling and data analysis as a scientist, lecturer and research student. I am interested in applying machine learning technology to solve complex real-world problems. 

## Experience:
Currently, I am working as a freelancer data scientist. I undertake individual project from clients and solve their business problems. I am also [teaching](https://www.royalroads.ca/people/rudra-shrestha) Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the School of Environment and Sustainability, Royal Roads University, Victoria, Canada. Previously (2019-2020), I worked as a Research Associate at the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research, The University of Manchester, UK. At the Tyndall Center, I was involved in a number of climate change research projects from proposal writing to research and coordination focusing on decarburization of transport sectors including alternative sustainable fuels, negative emission technologies and market-based mechanisms in collaboration with multi-national stakeholders to address urgency of climate change mitigation as set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. In particular, I led a project MITAC (MITigating Aviation impacts on Climate) which was developing a contrail-climate model to quantify the impacts of aviation on climate. Prior to joining the Tyndall Center, I have worked as a Climate Modelling Scientist (2013-2018) at Canadian Center for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma), the University of Victoria, Canada. During my PhD research at Manchester, I led the Himalayan Aerosol Cloud Interaction (HACI) field experiment which was conducted to monitor air quality in the foot-hills of the Nepal Himalayas. The HACI field experiment was complemented by a high-resolution modelling study to model the impacts of air pollution on regional climate. I am actively involving reviewing academic papers from ERL, Climate Policy and MDPI journals.

## Credentials:
I have received PhD degree in Atmospheric Science from the University of Manchester, UK, and MSc degree in Environmental Science from the UNESCO-IHE, the Netherlands. The degree programs were fully-funded by the Dorothy-Hodgkin Post-graduate Scholarship Program and the Netherlands Fellowship Program, respectively. I have obtained bachelorâ€™s degree in Civil Engineering from Institute of Engineering, Kathmandu, Nepal. Recently, I have successfully completed a 11-week online Machine Learning course offered by the Stanford University.
